We give up based on any existing library system, and try to make a PHP interactive system of library management system based on our demo picture,Although the appearance is not beautiful, it still meets our most basic core functions.
And all developed by ourselves, without using other people's code base.

~~~
We are utilizing the GitHub repository located at "https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Library-Management-System". 
  To run the project, you need to use XAMPP and create a database named jnu. 
  After that, import the file eb_lms.sql into the database.
  
Please note that the original PHP code was created in 2014 and is compatible only with PHP version 5.0. 
We have updated the code to use mysqli, making it suitable for PHP versions 8.0 and above.
